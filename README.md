This 2D Platformer Game Design prototype was created with my 3 fellow groupmates, its published version contains a debug level as well as 2 game levels ready to play! Together we developped sound effects, music, animations, UI, narration, graphics and game mecanics using **Construct3** with **JavaScrip**.
