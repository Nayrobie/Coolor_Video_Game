This 2D Platformer Game Design prototype was created with my 3 fellow groupmates, its published version contains a debug level as well as 2 game levels ready to play! Together we developped sound effects, music, animations, UI, narration, graphics and game mecanics using **Construct3** with **JavaScrip**.

## The Level Design of the Game 

For the level design, I wanted to create a game whith little to no indications for the player, meaning the goal of the level and how to naviguate it had to be easy to understand. We started with a simple draft, then created it digitally in Adobe and tested it in the game engine, finally we continued developping the background and game assets and improved the graphics.
